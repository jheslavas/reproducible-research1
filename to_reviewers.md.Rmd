This is a document to explain difficulties that I had uploading my files from the master github to the remote repository. It was not possible to get the figures included in the Rmd file, at the remote repository. 

I looked for suggestions at stackoverflow, but all of them did not work. 

Finally, I upload this document with the URL address showing the html file published in Rpbus

[This is the address]("http://rpubs.com/jheslavas/386874")

"http://rpubs.com/jheslavas/386874"

Please check it, before you grade my work. 

Thanks
